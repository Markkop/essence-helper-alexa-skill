# How to develop

```
ask configure
ask init --hosted-skill-id amzn1.ask.skill.db94a83e-4fe1-4dcc-87ae-afb9535d8e6e
cd lambda && npm install && cd ..
git remote add github git@github.com:Markkop/essence-mage-alexa-skill.git

Compiled folder "dist" have to be commited since this project is a Alexa-hosted skill (which is free) and therefore we have to build the javascript code before sending it to Amazon.
